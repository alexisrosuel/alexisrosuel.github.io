I am a Ph.D student at [Université Marnes la Vallée](http://www.u-pem.fr/), working in the Signal research team, which is part of the [Laboratoire d'Informatique Gaspard Monge](http://ligm.u-pem.fr/accueil/) laboratory. My Ph.D is under the supervision of [Philippe Loubaton](http://www-syscom.univ-mlv.fr/~loubaton/) and [Cristina Butucea](http://perso-math.univ-mlv.fr/users/butucea.cristina/).

I am currently working on large random matrices applications for signal processing and statistics. A more detailed abstract is available [here](http://www.theses.fr/s210399).

Before that, I was a master student in statistics at [Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Economique](https://www.ensae.fr/) (ENSAE) and had a 18 months professional experience as data scientist and software engineer, working on dynamic pricing and Adtech challenges. A detailed CV is available [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexis-rosuel/).

My research interest lie in the application of random matrix theory to statistics, especially those related with time series.
