I am a Ph.D student at [Université Marnes la Vallée](http://www.u-pem.fr/), working in the Signal research team, which is part of the [Laboratoire d'Informatique Gaspard Monge](http://ligm.u-pem.fr/accueil/) laboratory. My Ph.D is under the supervision of [Philippe Loubaton](http://www-syscom.univ-mlv.fr/~loubaton/) and [Cristina Butucea](http://perso-math.univ-mlv.fr/users/butucea.cristina/).

My work lies in the application of large random matrix theory for signal processing and statistics. More specifically, I try to understand how some estimators of the spectral coherency matrix behaves in the high-dimensional case, in order to construct new statistical tests which are consistent in high-dimensional regimes. A more detailed abstract is available [here](http://www.theses.fr/s210399).

Before that, I was a master student in statistics at [Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Economique](https://www.ensae.fr/) (ENSAE) and had a 18 months professional experience as data scientist ([Hostnfly](https://www.hostnfly.com/)) and software engineer ([Tradelab](https://tradelab.com/)), working on dynamic pricing strategies and Ad-tech challenges. More details are available on my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexis-rosuel/).
